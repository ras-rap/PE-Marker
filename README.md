Go check the indivual readmes for the part you want, aka all of them if you want to self host. IDK why you would though

The extension can be found at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/private-equity-marker/ for Firefox, and for Chrome can be found in github releases, or here https://github.com/ras-rap/PE-Marker/releases/download/Main/Chrome.zip (I can be bothered to pay Google for this extension)
